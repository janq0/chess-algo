# My chess program

My chess program lets you play chess with a computer opponent. It includes a
graphical chessboard with drag&drop functionality, but miscellaneous
information and actions like promotions are handled by a command-line
interface.

It is a part of my high school graduation thesis. The source code might also be
useful as an educational resource for someone who is studying chess programs.

Everything is written in C doesn't depend on any external libraries except for
raylib, which is used for the graphical chessboard user interface.
